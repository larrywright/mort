This is a rails template for creating projects that use MongoDB instead of a traditional database. It also includes the gems I typically use for projects, the 960.gs CSS framework, and the JQuery Javascript library.

This is in its early stages. Instructions and more detailed documentation are forthcoming.

Based on the initial gist from bscofield: http://gist.github.com/181842 and also inspired by Mike Gunderloy's Big Old Rails Template: http://github.com/ffmike/BigOldRailsTemplate
